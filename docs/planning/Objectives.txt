The idea here is to create an application that citizens can use to submit pressing issues, grievances, and suggestions to elected officials.
Once the submission window is closed, people can vote/endorse submissions for a similarly limited amount of time.
At some point, lawmakers address submissions via various means; (ideally for citizens) resulting in legislature or
(ideally for lawmakers) resulting in proof that the submission is already addressed by other means and communication to the submitter.

The main goal here is to connect constituents with their elected officials quickly for matters that are directly affecting them.
